# Address Management - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

✅ **Obx Error** - Changed from reactive Obx to StatefulWidget with setState  
✅ **User Flow** - Now map opens first, then address details bottom sheet  
✅ **Bottom Sheet Design** - Matches your provided image exactly  
✅ **Pre-filled Address** - Address automatically filled from map selection  

## 🚀 User Flow

```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File: `add_address_dialog.dart`
```dart
class AddAddressBottomSheet extends StatefulWidget {
  final String address;
  final double? latitude;
  final double? longitude;
  // Uses setState for local UI state (not Obx)
}
```

### File: `customer_profile_controller.dart`
```dart
// Navigate to map, then show bottom sheet
Future<void> showAddAddressDialog() async {
  final result = await Get.toNamed('/SeletedMapScreen', 
    arguments: {'returnData': true}
  );
  
  if (result != null) {
    Get.bottomSheet(
      AddAddressBottomSheet(
        address: result['address'],
        latitude: result['latitude'],
        longitude: result['longitude'],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Address Type Chips
```dart
[Home]  [Work]  [Other]
```
- Blue background when selected
- Grey border when not selected
- Uses setState to update

### Text Fields
```dart
Address / Building Name
_______________________

Flat / Villa No.
_______________________

Directions (Optional)
_______________________
```
- Simple TextField with underline border
- Grey hint text
- Primary color when focused

### Save Button
- Yellow/primary color
- Full width
- Rounded corners

## 📝 Map Return Format

Your map screen must return:
```dart
Get.back(result: {
  'address': 'Full address string',
  'latitude': 25.1234,
  'longitude': 55.5678,
});
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Bottom sheet doesn't appear after map
**Fix:** Check map screen returns data in correct format

### Issue: Address not pre-filled
**Fix:** Ensure map returns 'address' key in result

### Issue: Obx error
**Fix:** ✅ Already fixed - using StatefulWidget

## 📊 State Management

| Component | State Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| Address List | RxList (Reactive) |
| Selected Address | RxString (Reactive) |
| Type Chips | setState (Local) |
| Text Fields | TextEditingController |
